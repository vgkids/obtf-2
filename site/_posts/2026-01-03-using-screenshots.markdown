I often want to add images as context for something I'm writing.

In OBTF-2, you can drag/drop an image onto your notes and two things happen:
1. The file is moved to `OBTF-2/media`
2. The file name is added to your notes

When the add the name of an image from /media to your notes, it displays on the sidebar:

![OBTF-2 Screenshot displaying a screenshotfile](/assets/images/obtf-2-using-screenshots.png)

Things to know:

1. If you delete the file name from your notes, it will NOT delete the media file from OBTF-2/media
2. If you delete the file from OBTF-2/media, the name will still be in your notes, but the image will not appear
