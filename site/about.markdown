OBTF-2 was written by [James Marks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameslmarks/) as part of an annual investment in taking better notes. It's a little piece of self-investment I do between Christmas and New Year's, and this year it came out well enough to share. It's written using [Tauri](https://tauri.app), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and [VueJs](https://vuejs.org). This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
